### 3. First Run Setup

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. On first run, your default browser will open
4. Sign in with your Google account
5. Click "Allow" to grant calendar access

## Usage

- The widget shows your next 10 upcoming events
- Events auto-refresh every 15 minutes
- Click "Refresh" to manually update events
- Notifications appear:
  - 30 minutes before each event
  - 3 minutes before each event
- Click notifications to dismiss them

## Security Notes

- The application uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- Credentials are stored locally in `token.pickle`
- Only read-only calendar access is requested
- No data is sent to any third parties

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:
1. Delete `token.pickle` if it exists
2. Ensure `credentials.json` is in the correct directory
3. Restart the application
4. Go through the OAuth flow again
